More than half of those would be at level 1, according to presentation documents. That total number is expected to balloon to almost 48,000 by fiscal 2025.</p>\n<p>The number of contracts with CMMC requirements will, theoretically, explode as well with 75 contracts including it by fiscal 2022, 250 contracts by 2023 and 479 contracts in 2024, according to the DOD presentation documents.</p>\n<p>The CMMC Accrediting Body, an independent, not-for-profit group responsible for development assessment standards and training, is slated to deliver a draft of “CMMC 101” training in February.</p>\n<p>Ty Schieber, the CMMC Accrediting Body chair, told FCW following the event that “solidification of schedule will occur once we get the relationship codified” via memorandum of understanding and “mutually agree upon what we can do and what that means in terms of hitting those guidelines.”</p>\n<p>According to the DOD documents, that memo is to be signed in February and is still listed as “to be determined.”</p>\n<p>Schieber said the CMMCAB officially formed as a business entity over the weekend and has selected a board of directors. By next week, committees will be formed.</p>\n<p>“We formed as a business entity two days ago. We now have a board of directors. So what will follow in short order, like next week is establishing the committees that are led by board directors,” Schieber said, adding that pathways exploring accreditation, certification, training, infrastructure and assessment operations would be considered in the process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We formed as a business entity two days ago.
